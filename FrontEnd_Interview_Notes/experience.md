## Your role and responsibilities:

---

In my role, I developed Toyota's frontend UI using React, emphasizing a modular Micro Frontend architecture for scalable and maintainable code. I integrated Google Maps to provide location-based showroom searches, enhancing user experience. To improve performance, I employed lazy loading, code splitting, and image optimization. For state management, I used Redux and RTK 16.3, and handled asynchronous operations with Redux-Saga. I adhered to best coding practices with eslint, maintained a standard file structure, and styled the application using Tailwind CSS and SCSS. Throughout the project, I focused on efficient code management, build optimization, and implemented design patterns and caching mechanisms.

## Performance Optimization:
**Performance Optimization in React** involves several strategies and techniques to ensure that applications run smoothly and efficiently. Here are key areas to focus on:

1. **Lazy Loading**:
   - **Purpose:** Load components or assets only when needed to reduce initial load time.
   - **Implementation:** Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to dynamically import components.
   - **Example:** 
     ```javascript
     const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

     function App() {
       return (
         <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
           <MyComponent />
         </React.Suspense>
       );
     }
     ```

2. **Code Splitting**:
   - **Purpose:** Divide your codebase into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand.
   - **Implementation:** Use dynamic imports and `React.lazy` to split code.
   - **Example:** 
     ```javascript
     import { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

     const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

     function App() {
       return (
         <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
           <LazyComponent />
         </Suspense>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **Memoization**:
   - **Purpose:** Prevent unnecessary re-renders by memoizing values and callbacks.
   - **Implementation:** Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations and `useCallback` for functions.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
     const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { /* callback */ }, [dependencies]);
     ```

4. **Avoiding Inline Functions**:
   - **Purpose:** Prevent re-creation of functions on every render.
   - **Implementation:** Define functions outside the render method or use `useCallback` to memoize them.

5. **Virtualization**:
   - **Purpose:** Render only visible items in a list to improve performance.
   - **Implementation:** Use libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

     function MyList() {
       return (
         <List height={150} itemCount={1000} itemSize={35} width={300}>
           {({ index, style }) => <div style={style}>Item {index}</div>}
         </List>
       );
     }
     ```

6. **Debouncing and Throttling**:
   - **Purpose:** Limit the rate at which a function is executed, especially for user input events.
   - **Implementation:** Use libraries like `lodash` for debouncing and throttling.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     import { debounce } from 'lodash';

     const handleChange = debounce((event) => {
       // handle input change
     }, 300);
     ```

7. **Image Optimization**:
   - **Purpose:** Reduce image size to improve load times.
   - **Implementation:** Use modern formats like WebP, and tools like `image-webpack-loader`.

8. **Minimizing Re-renders**:
   - **Purpose:** Optimize component rendering to avoid unnecessary updates.
   - **Implementation:** Use `React.memo` for functional components and `shouldComponentUpdate` for class components.

By employing these strategies, you can significantly enhance the performance of React applications, leading to a better user experience.


## macrotask queue
In JavaScript, the macrotask queue (also known as the task queue) is a part of the event loop mechanism that handles the execution of asynchronous code. Tasks in the macrotask queue are executed after the currently executing script has finished and any microtasks have been processed.

### Key Concepts

1. **Event Loop:**
   - The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by executing asynchronous callbacks.
   - It has two main phases: handling the macrotask queue and the microtask queue.

2. **Macrotask Queue:**
   - The macrotask queue includes tasks such as:
     - `setTimeout`
     - `setInterval`
     - `setImmediate` (Node.js)
     - `I/O tasks` (like file system operations in Node.js)
     - UI rendering tasks (in the browser)
   - Macrotasks are scheduled to run after the currently executing script and all microtasks have been processed.

3. **Microtask Queue:**
   - The microtask queue includes tasks such as:
     - Promises (`Promise.then`)
     - `MutationObserver`
     - `process.nextTick` (Node.js)
   - Microtasks are processed immediately after the currently executing script and before any macrotasks.

### Example Code

Here’s an example to demonstrate how macrotasks and microtasks are processed:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Macrotask 1');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Microtask 1');
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Microtask 2');
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Macrotask 2');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

### Execution Order

1. **Synchronous Code:**
   - The synchronous code runs first.
   - Outputs: `'Start'` and `'End'`.

2. **Microtasks:**
   - After the synchronous code, the event loop processes the microtask queue.
   - Outputs: `'Microtask 1'` and `'Microtask 2'`.

3. **Macrotasks:**
   - Finally, the event loop processes the macrotask queue.
   - Outputs: `'Macrotask 1'` and `'Macrotask 2'`.

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Start
End
Microtask 1
Microtask 2
Macrotask 1
Macrotask 2
```

### Explanation

- **Synchronous Code:**
  - `'Start'` is logged immediately.
  - `'End'` is logged immediately after `'Start'`.

- **Microtasks:**
  - The two resolved promises are queued as microtasks.
  - `'Microtask 1'` and `'Microtask 2'` are logged after the synchronous code completes.

- **Macrotasks:**
  - The two `setTimeout` callbacks are queued as macrotasks.
  - `'Macrotask 1'` and `'Macrotask 2'` are logged after all microtasks have been processed.

### Summary

The macrotask queue in JavaScript handles tasks like `setTimeout` and `setInterval`, which are executed after the synchronous code and microtasks are completed. Understanding the event loop and the distinction between macrotasks and microtasks is crucial for effectively managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
